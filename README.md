# Metric Learning

## Overview

Metric learning is a technique used to learn a distance metric or similarity function from data. The goal is to create a meaningful representation space where similar objects are close to each other, while dissimilar objects are far apart. This is particularly useful for tasks that require fine-grained distinctions between data points.

## How It Works

Metric learning involves training a model to learn a distance function or a transformation that maps data points to a space where distances reflect the desired similarity. Common approaches include:
- **Contrastive Loss:** Encourages the model to minimize the distance between similar pairs and maximize the distance between dissimilar pairs.
- **Triplet Loss:** Uses triplets of data points (anchor, positive, negative) to ensure that the anchor is closer to the positive than to the negative.
- **Mahalanobis Distance:** Learns a Mahalanobis distance metric that accounts for correlations between features.

## Applications

Metric learning is widely used in various fields:
- **Face Recognition:** Learning a metric that distinguishes between different individuals.
- **Image Retrieval:** Finding similar images in large databases.
- **Recommendation Systems:** Improving item recommendations by learning similarity in user preferences.
